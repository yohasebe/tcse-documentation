# Using pause-and-check

One's language listening ability does not improve if he/she keeps watching transcript all the time. But without transcript, it is difficult to keep truck of the talk and grasp the message the speaker tries to convey through the talk. This is especially the case for learners of elementary and intermediate levels. Then what can they do? Use "pause-and-check" functionality of TCSE!

In fullscreen viewing mode on TCSE, the transcrpt and its translation text are shown only when the video is paused so that one can concentrate on language that he/she is hearing, instead of reading text on the screen. When there's anything that is not clear or difficult to understand, a "pause-and-check" will complement the understanding and make it easy to follow the talk.
