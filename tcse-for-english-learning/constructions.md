1,160 constructions (including veryous kinds of idiomatic expressions, phrasal verbs, etc.) have been collected that have multiple usage instances in TCSE database.  Though the procedure of collecting these constructions is not systematic but rather heuristic, the list will be helpful for users who are learners and educators of English.
